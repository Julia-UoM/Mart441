Homework 3

What I created:
I created a simple web page that links an external JavaScript file. The page has a background color, visible text, and JavaScript that logs my favorite websites, games, and artists to the console. I also included a prompt that asks the user a question and prints their answer to the console. I customized the content so it reflects my own interests.

What the generative AI/someone else created:
The generative AI produced a basic version of the same assignment with example websites, games, and artists. It showed how to structure the HTML and JavaScript and how to use console.log() and prompt(), but the did not reflect personalized choices or style.

How would you feel if you relied only on AI-generated output or someone else's work:
If I relied only on AI or someone else’s work, I would feel less confident that I actually learned the material. Even though the code might work, it would not feel like I truly understood how it was built or why things were written the way they were. Additionally, from an artistic stand point, something about entirely AI generated art projects can feel hollow or unauthentic.

Whether you could adequately explain the code that was written:
Yes! I believe I could explain how the code works. I understand how the HTML links to the JavaScript file, how console.log() outputs text to the console, how prompt() collects user input, and how comments help explain what different parts of the code do.

Whether the final work still feels like your own:
Yes. I believe that relying too heavily on generative AI is unproductive and a bit lazy, however, if it is used as a tool to expand and trouble shoot your individual ideas and projects I believe that it has the ability to strengthen personal expression rather than diminish it.
