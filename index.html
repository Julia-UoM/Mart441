    <h2>A Game Memory</h2>
    <p>
      My earliest video game memory is playing a browser based platformer called Tamale Loco. Taco Loco was a mouse
      who in efforts to win over the father of his crush, was collecting bizarre ingredients such as strawberries and sardines to make burritos.
      I spent countless hours playing this on dial-up internet in my parents home office. 
      For as long as I can remember, I have loved games of all kinds and have been curious about what went in to making them.

  <section class="section light">
    <h2>How I See the World</h2>
    <p>
      I see the world as a web of interconnected stories. Games reflect that.
      They let us experiment with choices, consequences, and identities in a safe space.
      I think games can help us understand complex problems by letting us play with them and allow us to exercise empathy in an immersive way.
